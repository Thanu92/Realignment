# Testing Bioinformatic Approaches for Phylogenetic Trees

This repository contains the codes and datasets generated and analyzed during the study:

**"Testing bioinformatic approaches for building large phylogenetic trees by placing DNA barcode sequences (COI) on backbone trees."**

## Overview

This repository includes:

- **Scripts:** Used for data analysis and visualization.
- **Processed Data Files:** Includes the realigned sequences from the FishTree of Life dataset, with sequences that had issues removed.
- **Phylogenetic Tree Files:** Contains readable phylogenetic trees of the main and subtrees of the reference tree used in this research.

## Contents

- `scripts/` - Contains the code used for data analysis and visualization.
- `data/` - Contains processed data files and sequences.
- `trees/` - Contains phylogenetic tree files.
